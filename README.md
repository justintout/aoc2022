# Advent of Code 2022

> here we go again

[grug](https://grugbrain.dev/) no make Advent of Code complicated this year.
grug just want to actually finish all days. 
even better if solve puzzle same day is released. 
grug know complexity bad. 
grug know puzzle inputs and way to run code already in same place.
grug just use devtools and javascript this year.

follow along grug. 
just can paste code blocks into devtools for solutions.
mostly dont reload inputs page when solve part 1.

first day solve with `awk` because funny. 
throw off [github code counter](https://github.com/github/linguist) since solutions all in markdown files.
grug no care.
